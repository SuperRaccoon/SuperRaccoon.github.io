        		<div class = "container" id = "about_container_container" >ISAB provides a positive intellectual and social atmosphere for students from diverse backgrounds. We host numerous events to promote awareness of international culture to the campus community, while strengthening Berkeley's multicultural community. ISAB provides resources to the international community professionally, socially, and culturally. Along with our Officer team, we have 8 committees including Events, Marketing, International Student Development, Finance, Tech, Historians, Social, and Alumni Relations, and we accommodate for over 600 members.</div>

        		<div class = "container" id = "about_container_container" style="color:white;">Want to learn more about ISAB? Want to join in cultural events and meet international students? Want to meet and mingle with amazing ISAB members? Come to one of our events! ISAB regularly hosts exciting events, such as our International Cup, a soccer tournament, in order to connect with the international community and fellow Berkeley students. Our events are usually either free or just a few dollars, and are a great chance to make some new friends from diverse backgrounds.</div>

        		<div class = "container" id = "about_container_container" style="color:white;">One of ISAB's core focuses is on mentorship, both internally and externally. Internally we have the iBig/iLittle system, in which a new member is paired with an older member, allowing for a go-to person for guidance in ISAB and for everything else. Externally, our Collaborative Events committee coordinates with the Berkeley International Office to host workshops for international and domestic students alike. </div>

        		<div class = "container" id = "about_container_container" style="color:white;">ISAB loves to have fun! Socials are common, both planned and just regular get-togethers and hang outs. In addition to social events such as day trips to amusement parks and dinners, we have our once-per-semester retreat, which will be at Santa Cruz this semester! This weekend long trip is always a highlight of the semester, exploring the greater California region and also getting to know your fellow ISAB'ers over a relaxing and fun few days!</div>
