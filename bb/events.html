                    <p>Attention Berkeley Bears! Have you flown on 16 hour flights from the comfort of your gorgeous home to come and study at Berkeley? Do you break out crying watching Korean dramas or hope to road trip around Europe once you graduate? Forget being bilingual, can you speak three languages or four?

If so, come out to International Students Association at Berkeley (ISAB)'s First General Meeting and our First General Social! <b>Refreshments and SLIVER pizza will be served!</b> ISAB is open to everyone, regardless of nationality!
