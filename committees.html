You can look forward to dinner trips, social mixers, the iBig/iLittle mentorship system, well as our member retreat near Santa Cruz! Here at ISAB, we're all about having fun, and we don't want you to miss out. Come help us form life-lasting bonds as a member of the social committee!</p>

        <p>The collaborative events committee will focus on the general membership events and create a tightly knit and organized family system for everyone! We want as many international and domestic students to feel welcomed at ISAB, and we will be planning events such as a bowling night, ISAB professional alumni panel, Berkeley Project, and many other monthly events to have fun with all our general members. </p>

        <p>International Program Committee's responsibilities will mainly focus on hosting the "Meet the Bears" Summer Program. The "Meet the Bears" Program consists of current students and alumni preparing an orientation in their respective countries to help new incoming fall freshmen adjust to Berkeley. As specific and important our task is, the committee chair and members will be working closely together, coordinating the event with ASUC, Berkeley International Office (BIO), and International Alumni Relations. Furthermore, International Programs will serve as a liason between ISAB and BIO for cooperating on events such as iMixes. Hope we have fun together this semester!</p>
